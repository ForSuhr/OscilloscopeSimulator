# Measurement Monitor
This is a repository of measurement interface for data acquisition. 

I made this user interface in my spare time out of my personal interest and for my friends' reference only. 

Note that it requires the appropriate digitizer and hardware peripherals to work properly.

## Requirements
Qt version: 6.3.2

msvc2019 64

Digitizer and AFEs (type and version are not publicly released)
